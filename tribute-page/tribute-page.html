                <p class="album__desc">Quiet Is the New Loud is the debut album by Norwegian indie pop duo Kings of
                    Convenience, released on 29 January 2001 by Astralwerks.
                    Quiet Is the New Loud received mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. At
                    Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the
                    album received an average score of 71, based on 11 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable
                    reviews". Caroline Hennessy of RTE was quoted saying that "If quiet is indeed the new loud then
                    Eirik and Erlend are on to a sure winner. A bittersweet pop album to wrap yourself up in when the
                    world feels like a scary place.</p>

                <p class="album__desc">Peace or Love is the sound of two old friends exploring the latest phase of their
                    lives together and finding new ways to capture that elusive magic they’ve so artfully retained over
                    the years. The album was recorded across five years in five different cities, and the album is
                    perfect for the transition from spring to summer: 11 songs about life and love with the alluring
                    beauty, purity, and emotional clarity that fans of the band have come to know and love.
